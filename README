 Currently in 'alpha'. To run unit tests, compile with flag 'test':
 
   $ make test
   $ ./test
   
 To compile for normal use:
 
   $ make
 
 This will construct the test harness 'harness', and a test input construction
 program, 'make_input'. This will require that the FFTW is installed.
 
================================================================================ 
 
 'make_input'  Can be used to construct test intstances from arbitrary input
               data. 

                 $ ./make_input test.test dna.50MB 3000 30 - n 10000

               Will create a test input with pattern size 3000, text size
               10,000 from an input file called dna.50MB.


 
 'harness'     Will load output created by 'make_input' and perform various
               approximate string matching algorithms on the results.

                 $ ./harness ./test.test -kangaroo

               Will load the test 'test.test' and run the O(nk) 
               Kangarooing algorithm by Landau and Vishkin.


 'test.py'     Python test script that will create and run many different
               tests and take averages over the results. See file for
               usage details.


 'plot'        A Gnuplot plotting script intended to load output from the test
               script. See file for usage details
